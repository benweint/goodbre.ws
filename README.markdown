# [goodbre.ws][goodbre.ws]

Sit back and have a beer.

goodbre.ws is a Rails application powered by [Recommendable][recommendable] to provide recommendations for beer.

_NOTE: Yes, goodbre.ws is temporarily down as I rewrite the site. If you want to follow the rewrite, check it out at [goodbrews/goodbre.ws][rewrite]._

If you would like to help me keep goodbre.ws up and running and/or further the rewrite, please consider a small Gittip to [support my open source software][gittip]. I pay for hosting out-of-pocket, and all work I do on goodbre.ws is in my spare time and, so far, on my own. Thank you!
